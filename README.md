# Earquake Globe Web Application project
## By Jacob Novak, Adam Holbel, and Danny Mendoza

## About
----
This project was developed using docker to containerize a mysql database, a goland backend, and a nextjs frontend.

The goal of creating this full stack web-application was to allow users to view earthquake data across the globe by interacting with a globe.

### How to Run
----
To Run this application clone the repository.

Once the repository is stored locally on your machine:
1. Navigate to the root directory of the project
2. run the command **docker-compose up --build -d**

This will containerize the full stack and will allow you to run the program.
